# Nuclear Reactor - Computer Model 
A computer model to simulate the fission chain reaction in a Nuclear Reactor's core 

**Author:** _Omer Hen_

**Purpose:** Hemda: Computational Science Course 2017-2018 Final Project 

## Short Description

This model simulates a Nuclear Reactor's core; or more spesificly the Fission Chain Reaction within the core. Whilst not taking into account parameters like pressure, temperture, mass and geometric form of neutrons and Uranium-235 particles, this model simulates fission under other coditions like size of the core, amount of fuel particles, whether or not fuel particles are dispensable, power-ouput required from the reactor, number of control rods inserted and ejected from the core, speed of neutrons, number of initial neutrons in the core and the distance in which particles are allowed to interact and collide with one another. 

## How to Use

Download the Reactor folder, this folder contains the Reactor python file, which is the main file in the model the Documentation file, as well as a few other libraries and folders. Run the Reactor file. This will open the simulation window with the power-output graph and the actuall representation of the reactor's core. After reaching a satisfactory number of iterations, close the simulation or simply right-click it to pause it and open the Documentation file. There, paste the data file's name into the appropriate variable (The data file's path was printed onto the Reactor's console at the beginnig of the simulation), then run Documentation. This should give you a k variable by number of iteration graph. 

**If you use Mac OS**

Open Data_lib and the Documentation and re-configure the paths to for it to work in your computer, this model was initially built for windows.
