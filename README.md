## Short Description

This model simulates a Nuclear Reactor's core; or more spesificly the Fission Chain Reaction within the core. Whilst not taking into account parameters like pressure, temperture, mass and geometric form of neutrons and Uranium-235 particles, this model simulates fission under other coditions like size of the core, amount of fuel particles, whether or not fuel particles are dispensable, power-ouput required from the reactor, number of control rods inserted and ejected from the core, speed of neutrons, number of initial neutrons in the core and the distance in which particles are allowed to interact and collide with one another.
